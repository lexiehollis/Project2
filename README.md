# Road Safety Analysis

## Project Description
Using data from the National Highway Traffic Aafety Administration, this project examined trends in vehicle-related injuries and fatalities. It looks at accidents involving motorized vehicles and their occupants as well as those affecting pedestrians and cyclists. Queries included the following: 

**Age**: (A)What are the trends across the age continuum effect the fatality rate of riders/drivers vs pedestrians? Essentially, what ages are most likely to die inside the car, and what ages are most likely to die outside of the car? Are they the same, do the trends have any similarities?
**Big Picture**: (B) Graph the trend of fatalities in entire USA, (C) then graph the trend of fatalities in individual states. What are the differences, do they all have the same basic movement upward and downwards? (D) Which states are safest (could be cross referenced with states with high public transport use to find correlation)?
**Rural vs Urban**: (E)(F)Combine rural state data together and urban state data together, compare graphed trends (specifically death rates of vehicle types, and overall death rates across time).
**Vehicle**: (G)(H)Find which vehicles are most dangerous to be around (kill passengers) vs most dangerous to be inside.

## Getting Started
Setting up central project repository in Github
Cloning central project repository to each participants Intellij (git clone -https://github.com/RevJustis/P2.git)
Creation of separate branches in Github repository for queries, development, main, optimize, UI, userpass(user account information stored)
Ingest data from Natioal Highway Traffic Safety Administration
Downloading Zeppelin and launching in Intellij

## Usage
When you run the project, you will initially be prompted to create an account (or if you already have one to log in). Then, a menu you of options appears that allows you to choose between topics related to our query categories above.  Within each of these topics, you will then be able to choose individual queries and see results of those queries.
